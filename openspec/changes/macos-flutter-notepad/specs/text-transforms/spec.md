- **GIVEN** the caret on "b" in "a\nb"
- **WHEN** the user chooses Insert Blank Line Above Current
- **THEN** the text becomes "a\n\nb"

#### Scenario: Reverse line order
- **GIVEN** the document "1\n2\n3"
- **WHEN** the user chooses Reverse Line Order
- **THEN** the text becomes "3\n2\n1"

#### Scenario: Line operations are one undo step
- **GIVEN** the user ran Remove Duplicate Lines
- **WHEN** the user invokes Undo once
- **THEN** the original lines return

### Requirement: Sort lines
The system SHALL sort the selected lines (or all lines) ascending and descending by: lexicographic order, lexicographic ignoring case, locale order, integer value, decimal value with comma separator, decimal value with dot separator, and line length.

#### Scenario: Lexicographic ascending and descending
- **GIVEN** the lines "b\nC\na"
- **WHEN** the user sorts lexicographically ascending
- **THEN** the text becomes "C\na\nb"
- **AND WHEN** the user sorts lexicographically descending
- **THEN** the text becomes "b\na\nC"

#### Scenario: Ignoring case
- **GIVEN** the lines "b\nC\na"
- **WHEN** the user sorts lexicographically ascending ignoring case
- **THEN** the text becomes "a\nb\nC"

#### Scenario: Integers sort numerically
- **GIVEN** the lines "10\n9\n100"
- **WHEN** the user sorts as integers ascending
- **THEN** the text becomes "9\n10\n100"

#### Scenario: Decimals with comma and with dot
- **GIVEN** the lines "1,5\n1,25\n10,0"
- **WHEN** the user sorts as decimals (comma) ascending
- **THEN** the text becomes "1,25\n1,5\n10,0"
- **GIVEN** the lines "1.5\n1.25\n10.0"
- **WHEN** the user sorts as decimals (dot) ascending
- **THEN** the text becomes "1.25\n1.5\n10.0"

#### Scenario: Length
- **GIVEN** the lines "ccc\na\nbb"

- **WHEN** the user chooses Space to TAB (All)
- **THEN** runs of spaces that end on a tab stop become tabs and the rest are kept

### Requirement: Indent and outdent
The system SHALL indent the selected lines with Tab (Cmd/Ctrl+]) and outdent with Shift+Tab (Cmd/Ctrl+[), using the configured indent unit, and expose both under Edit > Indent.

#### Scenario: Indent selected lines
