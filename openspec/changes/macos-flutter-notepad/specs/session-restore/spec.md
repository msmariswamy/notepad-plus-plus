## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Persist all tabs on quit
The system SHALL write the state of every open tab to the app-data directory when the app quits. Untitled and dirty tabs SHALL store their full text; clean saved tabs SHALL store only their file path.

#### Scenario: Quit with untitled tabs
- **GIVEN** three untitled tabs containing text
- **WHEN** the user quits the app
- **THEN** the text of all three tabs is stored in the app-data directory

#### Scenario: Quit with a dirty saved file
- **GIVEN** a tab bound to a file with unsaved edits
- **WHEN** the user quits the app
- **THEN** the edited text is stored, and the file on disk is not modified

### Requirement: Restore tabs on launch
The system SHALL restore every stored tab with its content, title, file association, encoding, line endings and dirty state when the app launches.

#### Scenario: Relaunch restores unsaved tabs
- **GIVEN** the app was quit with two untitled tabs containing text
- **WHEN** the app is launched again
- **THEN** both tabs reappear with the same text and are marked modified

#### Scenario: Active tab restored
- **GIVEN** the third of five tabs was active at quit
- **WHEN** the app is launched again
- **THEN** the third tab is active

### Requirement: Contents only
The system SHALL restore text content only, and SHALL NOT be required to restore cursor position, scroll position or undo history.

#### Scenario: Cursor position after restore
- **WHEN** a tab is restored
- **THEN** the caret is at the start of the document

### Requirement: Snapshot while editing
The system SHALL write a debounced session snapshot after edits so unsaved text survives a crash or forced quit.

#### Scenario: Crash recovery
- **GIVEN** the user typed text in an untitled tab and stopped for more than the debounce interval
- **WHEN** the app process is killed and relaunched
- **THEN** the typed text is restored

### Requirement: Atomic session writes
The system SHALL write session files atomically so an interrupted write cannot corrupt the existing session.

#### Scenario: Interrupted write
- **GIVEN** a valid session exists
- **WHEN** the app is killed in the middle of a snapshot
- **THEN** the next launch loads either the previous or the new complete session

### Requirement: Corrupt or missing session handling
If the session store is missing or unreadable, the system SHALL start with an empty document and SHALL preserve the unreadable files for inspection instead of deleting them.

#### Scenario: Corrupt session file
- **GIVEN** `session.json` contains invalid JSON
- **WHEN** the app launches
- **THEN** an empty document opens, the bad file is renamed with a `.corrupt` suffix, and no crash occurs

### Requirement: Missing file on restore
If a restored tab's file no longer exists on disk, the system SHALL still restore any unsaved text and mark the tab as detached from the missing path.

#### Scenario: File deleted between sessions
- **GIVEN** a dirty tab bound to a file that was deleted
- **WHEN** the app launches
- **THEN** the tab opens with its stored text and indicates the file is missing
