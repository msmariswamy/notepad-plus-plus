# next-notepad

[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/msmariswamy/notepad-plus-plus?include_prereleases&label=release)](../../releases/latest)
[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/msmariswamy/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-next.yml?label=tests)](../../actions/workflows/notepad-next.yml)

A fast, cross-platform text and code editor for **macOS, Windows and Linux**, built with
[Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) (Rust) and [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net) (TypeScript).

Close the app and your unsaved tabs come back exactly as you left them.

## Features

- **Never lose text**: every open tab, saved or untitled, is stored on quit (and while you type) and restored on the
  next launch. Closing a tab can ask to save or be silent, your choice in Settings.
- **Powerful Find and Replace**: Find, Replace, Find in Files, Find in Projects and Mark, with Normal, Extended
  (`\n \r \t \0 \xNN`) and regular-expression modes, whole word, match case, in selection, backward, wrap around,
  Count, Find All, Replace All in all open tabs, and five mark styles with bookmarks.
- **JSON tools**: pretty-print (2 spaces, 4 spaces, tabs), compress, sort keys, escape and unescape, and validation that
  jumps to the error line and column.
- **Format Document** for JSON, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, XML, YAML and Java, with automatic language
  detection for untitled text.
- **Edit tools**: convert case, line operations (duplicate, remove duplicates, join, split, move, reverse, 14 sort
  orders), trim and tab/space conversion, indent and comment toggles, bookmarked-line operations.
- **Editing basics**: tabs, multiple carets, column selection, folding, syntax highlighting for 16 languages, light and
  dark themes, word wrap, show all characters (spaces, tabs, line endings), encoding and line-ending conversion.
